# Pollica: Initial Prompt

> Use this prompt to instruct an AI coding assistant to build a Pollica-like application with maximum creative freedom over technology choices, architecture, features, and implementation details.

---

Build a real-time audience response web application called **Pollica** (AGPL-3.0) where presenters create interactive sessions containing questions (multiple choice, true/false, short answer, and numeric), and audience members join anonymously using short join codes — no account required — to answer questions as they are presented live. Responses should stream to the presenter in real-time with visualizations like bar charts, word clouds, and histograms. The system needs three roles: admins who manage users and oversee all sessions, presenters who create and run their own sessions, and anonymous audience members who participate with just a display name. The audience experience should feel live and engaging, with countdowns when new questions appear and when questions are closing, and the whole application should be containerized with Docker Compose and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
